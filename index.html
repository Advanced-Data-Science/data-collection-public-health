        <h1>Assessing Consumer Risk and Validity of Consumer Products Using FDA Recall Data</h1>
        <p class="team-info">A Data Science Project by Daniel Blumberg, Sean Niez, Madelynn Smith, and Ainsley Williams</p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintains detailed records of product recalls, which are vital for public health. The goal of this project is to apply advanced data science methods, including time series analysis and clustering, to the FDA Recall records. This analysis is designed to uncover hidden trends and patterns in recall activity to transform raw records into actionable knowledge for public health agencies, manufacturers, and consumers.</p>
        <p>The primary dataset, **FDAcleaned.xlsx**, is sourced from public FDA records, covering ten fiscal years from October 1, 2014, to September 30, 2024, and contains approximately 93,576 unique recall events.</p>

        <h2>Key Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Findings</h2>
        <div class="findings-grid">
            <div class="finding-card">
                <h3>Product Type Frequency</h3>
                <p>Recall activity is highly concentrated among certain product types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Devices:** 28,135 recalls (most frequent)</li>
                    <li>**Food/Cosmetics:** 22,502 recalls</li>
                    <li>**Drugs:** 13,124 recalls</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This may be due to high production and distribution volumes for these categories.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="finding-card">
                <h3>Recall Severity</h3>
                <p>Recall severity is measured by classification:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Class II:** 52,606 recalls (moderate risk)</li>
                    <li>**Class I:** 15,989 recalls (high risk, potential for serious injury or death)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The dominance of Class II and I recalls shows that significant risk management concerns persist across industries.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="finding-card">
                <h3>Geographic Concentration</h3>
                <p>Recall activity is concentrated in states that are major centers for manufacturing, distribution, and population:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>**California:** 8,037 recalls (highest count)</li>
                    <li>**Illinois:** 6,007 recalls</li>
                    <li>**New Jersey:** 4,535 recalls</li>

        <h2>Hypothesis Test Result: Is Recall Activity Seasonal?</h2>
        <div class="test-result">
            <p><strong>Question:</strong> Is there a statistically significant association between the time of year (quarter) and the mean number of product recalls?</p>
            <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> A One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the mean number of recalls across the four quarterly groups.</p>
            <div class="result-box">
                <p class="result-label">Statistical Decision</p>
                <p class="result-value"><strong>FAIL TO REJECT THE NULL HYPOTHESIS</strong></p>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The analysis yielded a p-value of **0.865** (with a significance level $\alpha=0.05$). Since the p-value is significantly larger than $\alpha$, there is **no statistically significant seasonal trend** in the mean number of recalls. Seasonality explains less than 2% of the total variance in recall volume.</p>
